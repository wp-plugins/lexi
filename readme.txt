An RSS feeder using ajax to show contents after the page has been loaded.

== Description ==

Sometimes an RSS feed has a low bandwidth and during the page creation Wordpress has to wait after those RSS feeds has been donwloaded. This plugin allow the site to read the RSS _after_ the page was created, not during the process.

You can use Tools -> Lexi to add, modify or delete your RSS feeds.

Add the Lexi widget to show your feeds, or you can add [lexi:id] in a page, or you can use the function `lexi(id)` in your template. The vatiable _id_ is optional, and defines the Feed to read. If you don't define _id_ the plugin will show all the feeds. There is a button in the RichText Editor to add a feed in a post.

This plugin requires __[minimax](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/minimax/ "A minimal Ajax library")__ in order to work.
